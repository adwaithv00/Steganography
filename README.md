# Steganography
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. This is the same principal that uses behind encrypting data. Here we can encrypt any text data in images and we can unencrypt them whenever the needed.
